[README]

This is an implement of " Recovering High Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs", SIGGRAPH 1997
and "Gradient Domain High Dynamic Range Compression", SIGGRAPH 2002.


You can change the test case by changing the file name and the file path.
Be sure that the input cases are under the exposure time of 1/60, 1/30, 1/15, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8 seconds.

If you want to choose the test points by yourself, you can remove the hdr_romm.mat.
Then, you can choose the points to compute.
